The tragic death of Yamin, a student of MIST, has left many questioning the events leading to his demise. Yamin was not just another student; he was among the brightest, securing a place in both the merit lists of BUET and medical entrance exams. The question that lingers is, why did this promising young man have to die? Why was such extreme force used against him?

A baton strike or a few slaps could have subdued him. But why was he shot with a shotgun? The use of Birdshot, a type of ammunition, was confirmed yesterday. Derrick Pounder, a forensic pathologist, examined photographic evidence of Yamin's death and informed Amnesty International that Yamin had been shot with Birdshot on the left side of his chest.

Do you know what happens when someone is shot in the chest with Birdshot?

The pellets from the Birdshot may have punctured Yamin's heart and lungs, leading to conditions like cardiac tamponade and pneumothorax. His aorta and pulmonary arteries might have been perforated, causing severe hemorrhaging and sending him into shock.

How could anyone be so cruel as to kill an innocent person so mercilessly?

It was revealed that on July 18, during a protest in Savar, Yamin did something incredibly brave. As students scattered in fear from bullets fired by the police from armored vehicles, Yamin, instead of running, courageously scaled a divider and climbed onto the police APC (armored personnel carrier) to prevent them from firing tear gas shells at the protesting students. It was then that he was mercilessly targeted and shot in the chest with Birdshot. Even after he was shot, he was coldly thrown off the APC onto the road like garbage, without any chance of survival.

What are our Bangladeshi forensic pathologists doing? While foreign experts can deduce so much detail from just photographs, our own forensic experts seem to be asleep at the wheel.
