Looking back at the remarkable achievement of our late brother Shykh Aash-Ha-Bul Yamin.

Last year, MIST Computer Club arranged the Independence Day Programming Contest 2023, an Inter Army University Programming Contest. Yamin and his team, MIST_JustCoders earned a well deserved prize by becoming the first solver of problem H. It was one of the least solved problems in the contest.
